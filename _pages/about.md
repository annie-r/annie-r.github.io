I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Bucknell University. My broad interest is in Human Computer Interaction. I am passionate about enabling diverse groups of people to access, interact with, and communicate information through technology. Currently, I research how to support designers, developers, testers, and accessibility specialists work collaboratively to improve software accessibility. I'm also working to integrate accessibility into undergraduate CS courses and prepare students to be accessibility champions.
            
I got my PhD from the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Washington, advised by James Fogarty and Jacob O. Wobbrock. I received my B.S. in computer science from Colorado State University. [demo.com](demo.com)

## Improving Software Accessibility

We aim to enhance the accessibility of smartphone applications for people with disabilities. Through interviews, literature review, and other participatory design approaches, we investigate: accessibility challenges, interaction styles of people with disabilities, developer workflow, and the accessibility of existing apps. We are developing a tool to automatically determine the accessibility of an app based on the insights gleaned from the above strategies. The insights and tool will then be extended to developer tools to support developing more accessible apps and end-user tools for finding accessbile apps or enhancing apps that pose accessibility challenges.
